## What's New for Today   
1. Effective Java
    - exception
        - use exceptions only for exceptional conditions
            - not use in ordinary control flows
            - state-dependent, state-test methods
            - optional
        - use checked exceptions for recoverable, unchecked exceptions for other cases
        - avoid unnecessary use of checked exception
            - checked exceptions mandate programmers to catch errors --> pros and cons but it clutters the program
            - dependency issue --> service - repository  service has to catch technical errors
        - favor use of standard exceptions
            - most of exceptions are already implemented
            - easy to use, maintain
        - throw exceptions appropriate to abstraction
            - higher classes can't predict lower classes' exception --> due to inheritance
            - transfer it to higher exception case
            - consider using exception chaining
        - document all exceptions
        - include failure-capture informations
            - error information must contain all of the parameters related to exception
        - strive for failure-atomicity
            - even though the method end successfully, the state must be consistent before and after the method execution
            - use copy of input paramters rather directly using them
            - check parameter before method execution
        - don't ignore exceptions
            - unhandled exceptions can slowly make the program dead
