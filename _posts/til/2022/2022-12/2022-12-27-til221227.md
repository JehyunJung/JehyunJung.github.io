## What's New for Today   
1. Effective Java
    - Concurrency Control
        - Synchronize access to shared mutable data
            - need care for race conditions
        - advoid execessive synchronization
            - cause of loss in performance
            - deadlock issues
        - prefer executors
            - 
        - prefer concurrency utilities rather than wait and notify
            - higher level abstraction
            - easy of use
        - document thread safe
        - use lazy initialization judiciously
            - double-edged sword
            - repeated initialization can make performance issue
        - don't depend on thread scheduler
            - make sure not to have number of runnable threads greater than number of processors
