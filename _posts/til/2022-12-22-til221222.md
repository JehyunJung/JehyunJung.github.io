## What's New for Today   
1. Effective Java
    - general programming
        - minimize the scope of local variables
            - minimizing error probability
            - make program predictable
        - prefer for-each loops
            - internal iterator, type convertion
        - know and use libraries
            - most of the codes are already implemented in libraries, and also it is high-quality
        - avoid float and double for exact computation
            - rather use bigdecimal
            - or convert to smaller units
        - prefer primitive types rather than boxed primitives 
            - performance issues: autobox/unboxing
            - nullability
        - avoid strings to represent value
            - not correctly work with equals, hashcode
            - converting into/outo string causes performance issues
        - beware of string concatenation
            - due to immutable instance, need copy 
        - refer objects by interfaces
            - make program flexble
            - OCP, DIP
        - prefer interfaces than reflection
            - runtime errors < compile time errors
        - use native methods judiciously
            - it may have better performance, but less portable and unpredictable(can cause memory corruption)
        - optimize judiciously
            - too much variables to consider
            - it may not have expected results
        - secure naming conventions
            - typographical and grammer conventions
